[LingPlus] Week 5 Group Assignment
=================================

We presented two approaches to classify Taiwan/China movie subtitle with Naive bayes this week. The subtitles were both first pre-segemented with the help of package `jieba`, and:
* Use tf-idf word features, then use scikit-learn Multinomial NB for Naive Bayes. Please refer to [this page](Week5_Rum.html) for detail.
* Use simple word frequency as features, and use tensorflow to implement Naive Bayes. Please refer to [this page](Week5_Sprite.html) for detail.
